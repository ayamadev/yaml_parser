# yaml_parser

yaml_parser enables to construct a ptree (Boost.PropertyTree) from a YAML file in a similar interface to the other parsers like json_parser and xml_parser.

Compiling the code requires yaml-cpp (https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp) and Boost.PropertyTree (http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_65_1/doc/html/property_tree.html).

Currently it has only read_yaml but no writing function.
